# 42-ML
42's Machine Learning Modules. A BootCamp.

A Machine Learning BootCamp which starts with the very basic concepts.

## Module 0:

Working with numpy arrays and manipulating them for Linear Algebra operations. Working with Matrix multiplication.
Calculating different types of loss functions.

## Module 1:

Understanding and working with a hypothesis and the MSE loss function. Implementing the gradient descent algorithm.
Minimizing the loss function using gradient descent and chosing the appropriate learning rate.

## Module 2:

Working with multivariate linear regression and building it from scratch. understanding overfitting and underfitting. Using cross validation to train the model better.

## Module 3:

implementing logestic regression from scratch. Understanding and working with decesion boundaries. Working with error metrics like accuraccy and precision, etc. Implementing a function to calculate the confusion matrix.
